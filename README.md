React component and hook for declarative promise resolution and data fetching. Makes it easy to handle every
state of the asynchronous process, without assumptions about the shape of your data or the type of request.
Use it with `fetch`, Axios or other data fetching libraries, even GraphQL.

- Zero dependencies
- Works with promises, async/await and the Fetch API
- Choose between Render Props, Context-based helper components or the `useAsync` and `useFetch` hooks
- Debug and develop every part of the loading sequence with the [DevTools](#devtools)
- Provides convenient `isLoading`, `startedAt`, `finishedAt`, et al metadata
- Provides `cancel` and `reload` actions
- Automatic re-run using `watch` or `watchFn` prop
- Accepts `onResolve`, `onReject` and `onCancel` callbacks
- Supports [abortable fetch] by providing an AbortController
- Supports optimistic updates using `setData`
- Supports server-side rendering through `initialValue`
- Comes with type definitions for TypeScript
- Works well in React Native too!

> ## Upgrading to v8
>
> Version 8 comes with breaking changes. See [Upgrading](#upgrading) for details.
> A [codemod](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async/tree/master/codemods) is available.

## Rationale

React Async is different in that it tries to resolve data as close as possible to where it will be used, while using
declarative syntax, using just JSX and native promises. This is in contrast to systems like Redux where you would
configure any data fetching or updates on a higher (application global) level, using a special construct
(actions/reducers).

React Async works well even in larger applications with multiple or nested data dependencies. It encourages loading
data on-demand and in parallel at component level instead of in bulk at the route/
page level. It's entirely decoupled
from your routes, so it works well in complex applications that have a dynamic routing model or don't use routes at all.

React Async is promise-based, so you can resolve anything you want, not just `fetch` requests.

### Concurrent React and Suspense

The React team is currently working on a large rewrite called [Concurrent React], previously known as "Async React".
Part of this rewrite is Suspense, which is a generic way for components to suspend rendering while they load data from
a cache. It can render a fallback UI while loading data, much like `<Async.Loading>`.

React Async has no direct relation to Concurrent React. They are conceptually close, but not the same. React Async is
meant to make dealing with asynchronous business logic easier. Concurrent React will make those features have less
impact on performance and usability. When Suspense lands, React Async will make full use of Suspense features. In fact,
you can already **start using React Async right now**, and in a later update, you'll **get Suspense features for free**.

[concurrent react]: https://github.com/sw-yx/fresh-concurrent-react/blob/master/Intro.md#introduction-what-is-concurrent-react

## Installation

```
npm install --save react-async
```

Or with Yarn:

```
yarn add react-async
```

> This package requires `react` as a peer dependency. Please make sure to install that as well.
> If you want to use the `useAsync` hook, you'll need `react@16.8.0` or later.

### DevTools

React Async comes with a separate DevTools package which helps you Debug and develop your asynchronous application states.

```
npm install --save react-async-devtools
```

Or with Yarn:

```
yarn add react-async-devtools
```

Then simply import it and render the`<DevTools/>` component at the root of your app:

```jsx
import DevTools from "react-async-devtools"

export const Root = () => (
  <>
    <DevTools />
    <App />
  </>
)
```

### Upgrading

#### Upgrade to v8

All standalone helper components were renamed to avoid import naming collision.

- `<Initial>` was renamed to `<IfInitial>`.
- `<Pending>` was renamed to `<IfPending>`.
- `<Fulfilled>` was renamed to `<IfFulfilled>`.
- `<Rejected>` was renamed to `<IfRejected`.
- `<Settled>` was renamed to `<IfSettled>`.

> A [codemod](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async/tree/master/codemods) is available to automate the upgrade.

#### Upgrade to v6

- `<Async.Pending>` was renamed to `<Async.Initial>`.
- Some of the other helpers were also renamed, but the old ones remain as alias.
- Don't forget to deal with any custom instances of `<Async>` when upgrading.

> A [codemod](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async/tree/master/codemods) is available to automate the upgrade.

#### Upgrade to v4

- `deferFn` now receives an `args` array as the first argument, instead of arguments to `run` being spread at the front
  of the arguments list. This enables better interop with TypeScript. You can use destructuring to keep using your
  existing variables.
- The shorthand version of `useAsync` now takes the `options` object as optional second argument. This used to be
  `initialValue`, but was undocumented and inflexible.

## Usage

React Async offers three primary APIs: the `useAsync` hook, the `<Async>` component and the `createInstance`
factory function. Each has its unique benefits and downsides.

### As a hook

The `useAsync` hook (available [from React v16.8.0](https://reactjs.org/hooks)) offers direct access to React Async's
core functionality from within your own function components:

```jsx
import { useAsync } from "react-async"

const loadCustomer = async ({ customerId }, { signal }) => {
  const res = await fetch(`/api/customers/${customerId}`, { signal })
  if (!res.ok) throw new Error(res)
  return res.json()
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useAsync({ promiseFn: loadCustomer, customerId: 1 })
  if (isLoading) return "Loading..."
  if (error) return `Something went wrong: ${error.message}`
  if (data)
    return (
      <div>
        <strong>Loaded some data:</strong>
        <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
      </div>
    )
  return null
}
```

> Using [helper components](#with-helper-components) can greatly improve readability of your render functions by not
> having to write all those conditional returns.

Or using the shorthand version:

```jsx
const MyComponent = () => {
  const { data, error, isLoading } = useAsync(loadCustomer, options)
  // ...
}
```

#### With `useFetch`

Because fetch is so commonly used with `useAsync`, there's a dedicated `useFetch` hook for it:

```jsx
import { useFetch } from "react-async"

const MyComponent = () => {
  const headers = { Accept: "application/json" }
  const { data, error, isLoading, run } = useFetch("/api/example", { headers }, options)
  // This will setup a promiseFn with a fetch request and JSON deserialization.

  // you can later call `run` with an optional callback argument to 
  // last-minute modify the `init` parameter that is passed to `fetch`
  function clickHandler() {
    run(init => ({
      ...init, 
      headers: {
        ...init.headers,
        authentication: "..."
      }
    }))
  }

  // alternatively, you can also just use an object that will be spread over `init`.
  // please note that this is not deep-merged, so you might override properties present in the 
  // original `init` parameter
  function clickHandler2() {
    run({ body: JSON.stringify(formValues) })
  }
}
```

`useFetch` takes the same arguments as [fetch] itself, as well as `options` to the underlying `useAsync` hook. The
`options` object takes two special boolean properties: `defer` and `json`. These can be used to switch between
`deferFn` and `promiseFn`, and enable JSON parsing. By default `useFetch` automatically uses `promiseFn` or `deferFn`
based on the request method (`deferFn` for POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE) and handles JSON parsing if the `Accept` header
is set to `"application/json"`.

[fetch]: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/WindowOrWorkerGlobalScope/fetch

### As a component

The classic interface to React Async. Simply use `<Async>` directly in your JSX component tree, leveraging the render
props pattern:

```jsx
import Async from "react-async"

// Your promiseFn receives all props from Async and an AbortController instance
const loadCustomer = ({ customerId }, { signal }) =>
  fetch(`/api/customers/${customerId}`, { signal })
    .then(res => (res.ok ? res : Promise.reject(res)))
    .then(res => res.json())

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Async promiseFn={loadCustomer} customerId={1}>
    {({ data, error, isLoading }) => {
      if (isLoading) return "Loading..."
      if (error) return `Something went wrong: ${error.message}`
      if (data)
        return (
          <div>
            <strong>Loaded some data:</strong>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
          </div>
        )
      return null
    }}
  </Async>
)
```

> Using [helper components](#with-helper-components) can greatly improve readability of your render functions by not
> having to write all those conditional returns.

### As a factory

You can also create your own component instances, allowing you to preconfigure them with options such as default
`onResolve` and `onReject` callbacks.

```jsx
import { createInstance } from "react-async"

const loadCustomer = ({ customerId }, { signal }) =>
  fetch(`/api/customers/${customerId}`, { signal })
    .then(res => (res.ok ? res : Promise.reject(res)))
    .then(res => res.json())

// createInstance takes a defaultProps object and a displayName (both optional)
const AsyncCustomer = createInstance({ promiseFn: loadCustomer }, "AsyncCustomer")

const MyComponent = () => (
  <AsyncCustomer customerId={1}>
    <AsyncCustomer.Fulfilled>{customer => `Hello ${customer.name}`}</AsyncCustomer.Fulfilled>
  </AsyncCustomer>
)
```

### With helper components

Several [helper components](#helper-components) are available to improve legibility. They can be used with `useAsync`
by passing in the state, or with `<Async>` by using Context. Each of these components simply enables or disables
rendering of its children based on the current state.

```jsx
import { useAsync, IfPending, IfFulfilled, IfRejected } from "react-async"

const loadCustomer = async ({ customerId }, { signal }) => {
  // ...
}

const MyComponent = () => {
  const state = useAsync({ promiseFn: loadCustomer, customerId: 1 })
  return (
    <>
      <IfPending state={state}>Loading...</IfPending>
      <IfRejected state={state}>{error => `Something went wrong: ${error.message}`}</IfRejected>
      <IfFulfilled state={state}>
        {data => (
          <div>
            <strong>Loaded some data:</strong>
            <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
          </div>
        )}
      </IfFulfilled>
    </>
  )
}
```

#### As compounds to `<Async>`

Each of the helper components are also available as static properties of `<Async>`. In this case you won't have to pass
the state object, instead it will be automatically provided through Context.

```jsx
import Async from "react-async"

const loadCustomer = ({ customerId }, { signal }) =>
  fetch(`/api/customers/${customerId}`, { signal })
    .then(res => (res.ok ? res : Promise.reject(res)))
    .then(res => res.json())

const MyComponent = () => (
  <Async promiseFn={loadCustomer} customerId={1}>
    <Async.Loading>Loading...</Async.Loading>
    <Async.Fulfilled>
      {data => (
        <div>
          <strong>Loaded some data:</strong>
          <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        </div>
      )}
    </Async.Fulfilled>
    <Async.Rejected>{error => `Something went wrong: ${error.message}`}</Async.Rejected>
  </Async>
)
```

## API

### Options

These can be passed in an object to `useAsync()`, or as props to `<Async>` and custom instances.

- `promise` An already started Promise instance.
- `promiseFn` Function that returns a Promise, automatically invoked.
- `deferFn` Function that returns a Promise, manually invoked with `run`.
- `watch` Watch a value and automatically reload when it changes.
- `watchFn` Watch this function and automatically reload when it returns truthy.
- `initialValue` Provide initial data or error for server-side rendering.
- `onResolve` Callback invoked when Promise resolves.
- `onReject` Callback invoked when Promise rejects.
- `onCancel` Callback invoked when a Promise is cancelled.
- `reducer` State reducer to control internal state updates.
- `dispatcher` Action dispatcher to control internal action dispatching.
- `debugLabel` Unique label used in DevTools.

`useFetch` additionally takes these options:

- `defer` Force the use of `deferFn` or `promiseFn`.
- `json` Enable JSON parsing of the response.

#### `promise`

> `Promise`

A Promise instance which has already started. It will simply add the necessary resolve/reject callbacks and set
`startedAt` to the time `promise` was first provided. Changing the value of `promise` will cancel any pending promise
and listen to the new one. If `promise` is initially undefined, the React Async state will be `pending`.

> Note that `reload` will not do anything when using `promise`. Use `promiseFn` instead.

#### `promiseFn`

> `function(props: Object, controller: AbortController): Promise`

A function that returns a promise. It is automatically invoked in `componentDidMount` and `componentDidUpdate`.
The function receives all component props (or options) and an AbortController instance as arguments.

> Be aware that updating `promiseFn` will trigger it to cancel any pending promise and load the new promise. Passing an
> arrow function will cause it to change and reload on every render of the parent component. You can avoid this by
> defining the `promiseFn` value **outside** of the render method. If you need to pass variables to the `promiseFn`,
> pass them as additional props to `<Async>`, as `promiseFn` will be invoked with these props. Alternatively you can
> use [memoization](https://github.com/alexreardon/memoize-one) to avoid unnecessary updates.

#### `deferFn`

> `function(args: any[], props: Object, controller: AbortController): Promise`

A function that returns a promise. This is invoked only by manually calling `run(...args)`. Receives the same arguments
as `promiseFn`, as well as any arguments to `run` which are passed through as an array. The `deferFn` is commonly used
to send data to the server following a user action, such as submitting a form. You can use this in conjunction with
`promiseFn` to fill the form with existing data, then updating it on submit with `deferFn`.

> Be aware that when using both `promiseFn` and `deferFn`, the shape of their fulfilled value should match, because they
> both update the same `data`.

#### `watch`

> `any`

Watches this property through `componentDidUpdate` and re-runs the `promiseFn` when the value changes, using a simple
reference check (`oldValue !== newValue`). If you need a more complex update check, use `watchFn` instead.

#### `watchFn`

> `function(props: Object, prevProps: Object): boolean | any`

Re-runs the `promiseFn` when this callback returns truthy (called on every update). Any default props specified by
`createInstance` are available too.

#### `initialValue`

> `any | Error`

Initial state for `data` or `error` (if instance of Error); useful for server-side rendering.

#### `onResolve`

> `function(data: any): void`

Callback function invoked when a promise resolves, receives data as argument.

#### `onReject`

> `function(reason: Error): void`

Callback function invoked when a promise rejects, receives rejection reason (error) as argument.

#### `onCancel`

> `function(): void`

Callback function invoked when a promise is cancelled, either manually using `cancel()` or automatically due to props
changes or unmounting.

#### `reducer`

> `function(state: any, action: Object, internalReducer: function(state: any, action: Object))`

State reducer to take full control over state updates by wrapping the [internal reducer]. It receives the current
state, the dispatched action and the internal reducer. You probably want to invoke the internal reducer at some point.

> This is a power feature which loosely follows the [state reducer pattern]. It allows you to control state changes by
> intercepting actions before they are handled, or by overriding or enhancing the reducer itself.

[internal reducer]: https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async/blob/master/src/reducer.js
[state reducer pattern]: https://kentcdodds.com/blog/the-state-reducer-pattern

#### `dispatcher`

> `function(action: Object, internalDispatch: function(action: Object), props: Object)`

Action dispatcher to take full control over action dispatching by wrapping the internal dispatcher. It receives the
original action, the internal dispatcher and all component props (or options). You probably want to invoke the internal
dispatcher at some point.

> This is a power feature similar to the [state reducer pattern]. It allows you to control state changes by
> intercepting actions before they are dispatched, to dispatch additional actions, possibly later in time.

#### `debugLabel`

> `string`

A unique label to describe this React Async instance, used in React DevTools (through `useDebugValue`) and React Async
DevTools.

#### `defer`

> `boolean`

Enables the use of `deferFn` if `true`, or enables the use of `promiseFn` if `false`. By default this is automatically
chosen based on the request method (`deferFn` for POST / PUT / PATCH / DELETE, `promiseFn` otherwise).

#### `json`

> `boolean`

Enables or disables JSON parsing of the response body. By default this is automatically enabled if the `Accept` header
is set to `"application/json"`.

### Render props

`<Async>` provides the following render props to the `children` function:

- `data` Last resolved promise value, maintained when new error arrives.
- `error` Rejected promise reason, cleared when new data arrives.
- `value` The value of `data` or `error`, whichever was last updated.
- `initialValue` The data or error that was provided through the `initialValue` prop.
- `startedAt` When the current/last promise was started.
- `finishedAt` When the last promise was fulfilled or rejected.
- `status` One of: `initial`, `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`.
- `isInitial` true when no promise has ever started, or one started but was cancelled.
- `isPending` true when a promise is currently awaiting settlement. Alias: `isLoading`
- `isFulfilled` true when the last promise was fulfilled. Alias: `isResolved`
- `isRejected` true when the last promise was rejected.
- `isSettled` true when the last promise was fulfilled or rejected (not initial or pending).
- `counter` The number of times a promise was started.
- `promise` A reference to the internal wrapper promise, which can be chained on.
- `run` Invokes the `deferFn`.
- `reload` Re-runs the promise when invoked, using any previous arguments.
- `cancel` Cancel any pending promise.
- `setData` Sets `data` to the passed value, unsets `error` and cancels any pending promise.
- `setError` Sets `error` to the passed value and cancels any pending promise.

#### `data`

> `any`

Last resolved promise value, maintained when new error arrives.

#### `error`

> `Error`

Rejected promise reason, cleared when new data arrives.

#### `value`

> `any | Error`

The data or error that was last provided (either through `initialValue` or by settling a promise).

#### `initialValue`

> `any | Error`

The data or error that was originally provided through the `initialValue` prop.

#### `startedAt`

> `Date`

Tracks when the current/last promise was started.

#### `finishedAt`

> `Date`

Tracks when the last promise was resolved or rejected.

#### `status`

> `string`

One of: `initial`, `pending`, `fulfilled`, `rejected`.
These are available for import as `statusTypes`.

#### `isInitial`

> `boolean`

`true` while no promise has started yet, or one was started but cancelled.

#### `isPending`

> `boolean`

`true` while a promise is pending (loading), `false` otherwise.

Alias: `isLoading`

#### `isFulfilled`

> `boolean`

`true` when the last promise was fulfilled (resolved to a value).

Alias: `isResolved`

#### `isRejected`

> `boolean`

`true` when the last promise was rejected.

#### `isSettled`

> `boolean`

`true` when the last promise was either fulfilled or rejected (i.e. not initial or pending)

#### `counter`

> `number`

The number of times a promise was started.

#### `promise`

> `Promise`

A reference to the internal wrapper promise created when starting a new promise (either automatically or by invoking
`run` / `reload`). It fulfills or rejects along with the provided `promise` / `promiseFn` / `deferFn`. Useful as a
chainable alternative to the `onResolve` / `onReject` callbacks.

#### `run`

> `function(...args: any[]): void`

Runs the `deferFn`, passing any arguments provided as an array.

#### `reload`

> `function(): void`

Re-runs the promise when invoked, using the previous arguments.

#### `cancel`

> `function(): void`

Cancels the currently pending promise by ignoring its result and calls `abort()` on the AbortController.

#### `setData`

> `function(data: any, callback?: () => void): any`

Function that sets `data` to the passed value, unsets `error` and cancels any pending promise. Takes an optional
callback which is invoked after the state update is completed. Returns the data to enable chaining.

#### `setError`

> `function(error: Error, callback?: () => void): Error`

Function that sets `error` to the passed value and cancels any pending promise. Takes an optional callback which is
invoked after the state update is completed. Returns the error to enable chaining.

## Helper components

React Async provides several helper components that make your JSX more declarative and less cluttered.
They don't have to be direct children of `<Async>` and you can use the same component several times.

### `<IfInitial>` / `<Async.Initial>`

Renders only while the deferred promise is still waiting to be run, or you have not provided any promise.

#### Props

- `children` `function(state: Object): Node | Node` Render function or React Node.
- `state` `object` Async state object (return value of `useAsync()`).
- `persist` `boolean` Show until we have data, even while loading or when an error occurred. By default it hides as soon as the promise starts loading.

#### Examples

```jsx
const state = useAsync(...)
return (
  <IfInitial state={state}>
    <p>This text is only rendered while `run` has not yet been invoked on `deferFn`.</p>
  </IfInitial>
)
```

```jsx
<Async deferFn={deferFn}>
  <Async.Initial>
    <p>This text is only rendered while `run` has not yet been invoked on `deferFn`.</p>
  </Async.Initial>
</Async>
```

```jsx
<Async.Initial persist>
  {({ error, isPending, run }) => (
    <div>
      <p>This text is only rendered while the promise has not fulfilled yet.</p>
      <button onClick={run} disabled={!isPending}>
        Run
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error.message}</p>}
    </div>
  )}
</Async.Initial>
```

### `<IfPending>` / `<Async.Pending>`

This component renders only while the promise is pending (loading / unsettled).

Alias: `<Async.Loading>`

#### Props

- `children` `function(state: Object): Node | Node` Render function or React Node.
- `state` `object` Async state object (return value of `useAsync()`).
- `initial` `boolean` Show only on initial load (when `data` is `undefined`).

#### Examples

```jsx
const state = useAsync(...)
return (
  <IfPending state={state}>
    <p>This text is only rendered while performing the initial load.</p>
  </IfPending>
)
```

```jsx
<Async.Pending initial>
  <p>This text is only rendered while performing the initial load.</p>
</Async.Pending>
```

```jsx
<Async.Pending>{({ startedAt }) => `Loading since ${startedAt.toISOString()}`}</Async.Pending>
```

### `<IfFulfilled>` / `<Async.Fulfilled>`

This component renders only when the promise is fulfilled (resolved to a value, could be `undefined`).

Alias: `<Async.Resolved>`

#### Props

- `children` `function(data: any, state: Object): Node | Node` Render function or React Node.
- `state` `object` Async state object (return value of `useAsync()`).
- `persist` `boolean` Show old data while loading new data. By default it hides as soon as a new promise starts.

#### Examples

```jsx
const state = useAsync(...)
return (
  <IfFulfilled state={state}>
    {data => <pre>{JSON.stringify(data)}</pre>}
  </IfFulfilled>
)
```

```jsx
<Async.Fulfilled persist>{data => <pre>{JSON.stringify(data)}</pre>}</Async.Fulfilled>
```

```jsx
<Async.Fulfilled>
  {(data, { finishedAt }) => `Last updated ${finishedAt.toISOString()}`}
</Async.Fulfilled>
```

### `<IfRejected>` / `<Async.Rejected>`

This component renders only when the promise is rejected.

#### Props

- `children` `function(error: Error, state: Object): Node | Node` Render function or React Node.
- `state` `object` Async state object (return value of `useAsync()`).
- `persist` `boolean` Show old error while loading new data. By default it hides as soon as a new promise starts.

#### Examples

```jsx
const state = useAsync(...)
return <IfRejected state={state}>Oops.</IfRejected>
```

```jsx
<Async.Rejected persist>Oops.</Async.Rejected>
```

```jsx
<Async.Rejected>{error => `Unexpected error: ${error.message}`}</Async.Rejected>
```

### `<IfSettled>` / `<Async.Settled>`

This component renders only when the promise is fulfilled or rejected.

#### Props

- `children` `function(state: Object): Node | Node` Render function or React Node.
- `state` `object` Async state object (return value of `useAsync()`).
- `persist` `boolean` Show old data or error while loading new data. By default it hides as soon as a new promise starts.

#### Examples

```jsx
const state = useAsync(...)
return <IfSettled state={state}>{state => `Finished at ${state.finishedAt.toISOString()}`</IfSettled>
```

## Usage examples

Here's several examples to give you an idea of what's possible with React Async. For fully working examples, please
check out the [`examples` directory](https://github.com/ghengeveld/react-async/tree/master/examples).

### Data fetching

This does some basic data fetching, including a loading indicator, error state and retry.

```jsx
class App extends Component {
  getSession = ({ sessionId }) => fetch(...)

  render() {
    // The promiseFn should be defined outside of render()
    return (
      <Async promiseFn={this.getSession} sessionId={123}>
        {({ data, error, isLoading, reload }) => {
          if (isLoading) {
            return <div>Loading...</div>
          }
          if (error) {
            return (
              <div>
                <p>{error.toString()}</p>
                <button onClick={reload}>try again</button>
              </div>
            )
          }
          if (data) {
            return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
          }
          return null
        }}
      </Async>
    )
  }
}
```

### Form submission

This uses `deferFn` to trigger an update (e.g. POST / PUT request) after a form submit.

```jsx
const subscribeToNewsletter = (args, props, controller) => fetch(...)

<Async deferFn={subscribeToNewsletter}>
  {({ error, isLoading, run }) => (
    <form onSubmit={run}>
      <input type="email" name="email" />
      <button type="submit" disabled={isLoading}>
        Subscribe
      </button>
      {error && <p>{error.toString()}</p>}
    </form>
  )}
</Async>
```

### Optimistic updates

This uses both `promiseFn` and `deferFn` along with `setData` to implement optimistic updates.

```jsx
const updateAttendance = ([attend]) => fetch(...).then(() => attend, () => !attend)

<Async promiseFn={getAttendance} deferFn={updateAttendance}>
  {({ data: isAttending, isLoading, run, setData }) => (
    <Toggle
      on={isAttending}
      onClick={() => {
        setData(!isAttending)
        run(!isAttending)
      }}
      disabled={isLoading}
    />
  )}
</Async>
```

### Server-side rendering

This uses `initialValue` to enable server-side rendering with Next.js.

```jsx
static async getInitialProps() {
  // Resolve the promise server-side
  const customers = await loadCustomers()
  return { customers }
}

render() {
  const { customers } = this.props // injected by getInitialProps
  return (
    <Async promiseFn={loadCustomers} initialValue={customers}>
      {({ data, error, isLoading, initialValue }) => { // initialValue is passed along for convenience
        if (isLoading) {
          return <div>Loading...</div>
        }
        if (error) {
          return <p>{error.toString()}</p>
        }
        if (data) {
          return <pre>{JSON.stringify(data, null, 2)}</pre>
        }
        return null
      }}
    </Async>
  )
}
```

## Acknowledgements

Versions 1.x and 2.x of `react-async` on npm are from a different project abandoned years ago. The original author was
kind enough to transfer ownership so the `react-async` package name could be repurposed. The first version of this
project is v3.0.0. Many thanks to Andrey Popp for handing over ownership of `react-async` on npm.
