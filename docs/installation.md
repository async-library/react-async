# Installation

You can install `react-async` from npm:

```text
npm install --save react-async
```

Or if you're using Yarn:

```text
yarn add react-async
```

> This package requires `react` as a peer dependency. Please make sure to install that as well. If you want to use the `useAsync` hook, you'll need `react@16.8.0` or later.
